Whether your organization wants to build a new application on Azure, or you're looking to move an entire datacenter to the cloud, estimating costs is a key part of your planning process to ensure a successful project. For example, how do you know which services to select, or which service tier or virtual machine (VM) size to choose? Do you provision VMs for your workload, or do you take advantage of higher-level services that can reduce operational costs?

Proper planning is incredibly important to any cloud project. Let's look at what you need to consider.

## Capture requirements

Before you start any cloud project, take time to plan properly. That's especially important when you're considering costs.

Start by identifying the stakeholders for the project. This should include the business teams that are driving the organizational outcomes. It should also include the technical teams involved in the project. Bring everyone together and foster a culture of transparency. All teams involved in the project should have visibility into the decisions that will affect costs.

Identify the business and technical requirements of your project:

- Business requirements might be an API to enable partner communications or a reporting interface for the accounting department to view financial transactions.
    
- Technical requirements might be the ability to store relational data, or the ability for users to use a personal identity to access applications.
    

Both of these requirements will affect the overall cost of the project. They'll also influence your selection of services.

After you've identified your requirements, you'll want to define the workloads that are in scope to use cloud services and identify the services and resources you'll use. This effort will include evaluating and comparing service options in order to select the best services to meet your requirements.

When you've listed all of the requirements, services, and resources for your project, you can begin to estimate your costs.

## Estimate costs

With your list of services captured, you can use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to create estimates of your application's cost. You can use the calculator to create, save, and share estimates for all Azure services.

As part of your cost estimation, it's also important to understand the subscription and billing models available on Azure. Two of the most common models are _pay-as-you-go_ and _enterprise agreement_:

- _Pay-as-you-go_ subscriptions give you the flexibility to purchase and use the services you need, with the advantage of having no up-front commitments.
    
- _Enterprise agreements_ let organizations take advantage of discounts through up-front commitments. These agreements allow organizations to centralize their Azure costs and billing. They can include other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365.
    

There are additional billing models. Each gives you access to the full suite of Azure services with the flexibility to purchase only what you need, when you need it.

No architecture is static, so you'll want your estimates to include any investments that you might be planning to make in the future. Taking the extra time to plan effectively for your application's future will give you better visibility into the long-term costs for your project, even if your costs might shift over time.

Evolving your architecture can reduce resources costs, such as moving from virtual machines to app services. It can also reduce operational costs by requiring less downtime for maintenance.

## Organize resources for cost awareness

It's also important to set up an organizational framework to enable the control, reporting, and attribution of costs throughout your environment.

You can use Azure Policy to create limitations for the size or tier of resources that can be provisioned. For example, you can prevent users from creating virtual machines from the G or M series, which have higher costs. If a need arises for VMs of those sizes, you can flow requests for those VMs through an exception process, where individual scenarios can be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis. These types of policies will prevent your organization from facing unexpected large bills from your users creating resources that are larger than your projects need.

You can let your users view reports and billing as needed by creating roles that allow them to view services such as Microsoft Cost Management. Allowing your users to view costs will help them see the impact of their business decisions. It also provides for transparency across the organization with respect to cloud-resource costs.

Organize your resources into resource groups or subscriptions. They can serve as boundaries for projects, business units, or services. You can also use Azure Policy to enforce the tagging of resources. Subscriptions, resource groups, and tags are exposed in billing reports. These reports will allow you to account for the usage of resources by product, business unit, or project.

## Budget for education

Educating your engineers, developers, and users is an important piece of a successful cloud project. The cloud is a transformational shift for an organization, and it's an ever-changing set of services and technologies. Your organization will need to ensure that your staff is properly trained to build and maintain resources on Azure. Microsoft Learn provides full product documentation along with self-paced training. Microsoft also has a large network of partners to deliver in-person and custom training for your staff.

Identify both the initial and ongoing training needs for your organization. Include this as part of the cost of your project.
