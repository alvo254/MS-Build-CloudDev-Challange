Azure DNS private resolver is a cloud-native, highly available, and DevOps-friendly service. It provides a simple, zero- maintenance, reliable, and secure DNS service to resolve and conditionally forward DNS queries from a virtual network, on-premises, and to other target DNS servers without the need to create and manage a custom DNS solution. Resolve DNS names hosted in Azure Private DNS Zones from on-premises networks and DNS queries for your own domain names.

This will make your DNS infrastructure work privately and seamlessly across on-premises networks and enable key hybrid networking scenarios.
