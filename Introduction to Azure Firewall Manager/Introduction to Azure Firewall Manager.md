Organizations with Azure-hosted resources want to secure access to those resources. Typically, they implement security technologies, such as firewalls, to create security perimeters. These perimeters can control traffic flow to and from hosted apps and other resources. However, as your organization's security requirements grow, it might become difficult to manage these security technologies. How can you simplify the management of your cloud-based security? Use Azure Firewall Manager to centralize your firewall-security policies and route management for your cloud-based security perimeters.

## Example scenario

Suppose your company has resources distributed across multiple Azure virtual networks. You might decide to configure Azure Firewall, a managed cloud-based security service. A firewall can help protect each resource-holding virtual network, as the following graphic depicts.

As your needs evolve, you can implement more Azure Firewall instances. Each should have similar rules governing traffic flow. Management becomes more difficult when you have a more complex virtual network, virtual WAN, and firewall settings. However, Firewall Manager enables you to centrally manage these components and more easily control your cloud-based security perimeters.
