Many organizations have applications they want to make available to their customers, their suppliers, and almost certainly their users. The tricky part is making sure those applications are highly available. In addition, they need to be able to quickly respond while being appropriately secured. Azure Front Door provides different SKUs (pricing tiers) that meet these requirements. Let's briefly review the features and benefits of these SKUs so you can determine which option best suits your requirements.

## What is a secure, modern cloud CDN?

A secure, modern cloud CDN provides a distributed platform of servers. This helps minimize latency when users are accessing webpages. Historically, IT staff might have used a CDN and a web-application firewall to control HTTP and HTTPS traffic flowing to and from target applications.

If an organization uses Azure, they might achieve these goals by implementing the products described in the following table:

|Product|Description|
|---|---|
|Azure Front Door|Enables an entry point to your apps positioned in the Microsoft global edge network. Provides faster, more secure, and scalable access to your web applications.|
|Azure Content Delivery Network|Delivers high-bandwidth content to your users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes around the world.|
|Azure Web Application Firewall|Helps provide centralized, greater protection for web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities.|

## Azure Front Door definition

_Azure Front Door Standard/Premium_ provides the capabilities of these three products. It offers a fast, reliable, and more secure modern cloud CDN by using the Microsoft global edge network to integrate with intelligent threat protection. Azure Front Door resides in the edge locations and manages user requests to your hosted applications. Users connect to your application through the Microsoft global network. Azure Front Door then routes user requests to the fastest and most available application backend.

 Note

An _application backend_ is any internet-facing service that you host, either inside or outside Azure.

The following Azure Front door SKUs are available:

- **Azure Front Door**, which is the entry level. Existing Azure customers often bolster these features with Azure Content Delivery Network, and Azure Web Application Firewall.
- **Azure Front Door Standard**, which is optimized for virtually seamless content delivery.
- **Azure Front Door Premium**, which is optimized for improved security.

Let's examine these last two SKUs in more detail.
