## How Private Link fits into an Azure virtual network

Private Link provides private access to Azure services. Here, "private" means that the connection uses the Microsoft Azure backbone network instead of the internet. To make that switch, Private Link changes the connectivity method for the Azure resource from public endpoint to _private endpoint_.

Now you don't access the Azure resource using a public IP address. Instead, you use a private IP address that Azure assigns to the resource from the address space of your subnet.

The key takeaway? The Azure resource is now effectively a part of your virtual network. Clients on your network can access this _Private Link resource_ just like any other network resource.

For even greater security, the connection to the resource now uses the Microsoft Azure backbone network. That is, any traffic to and from the resource entirely bypasses the public internet.

The resource's public endpoint still exists, however, even though you're not using it. The presence of a public endpoint, even an unused one, is still a security risk. Fortunately, it's possible to disable the Azure resource's public endpoint, which bypasses that potential security issue.

## How Azure Private Endpoint works

How do you shift a resource interface from public to private? Add an Azure Private Endpoint to your network configuration. Private Endpoint is a network interface that creates a private connection between your virtual network and a specified Azure resource.

Private Endpoint takes an unused private IP address from the address space of a specified subnet in your virtual network. For example, suppose you have a subnet that uses the address space 10.1.0.0/24. Virtual machines on that subnet use IP addresses such as 10.1.0.20 or 10.1.0.155.

Private Endpoint gets an IP address from the same address space, such as 10.1.0.32. Private Endpoint then maps that address to a specified Azure service. Using the private IP address effectively brings the service into your virtual network.

 Note

Clients that connect to a Private Link resource don't need to use the Private Endpoint's assigned IP address in the connection string. Instead, if you configure the Private Endpoint to integrate with your private DNS zone, then Azure automatically assigns a FQDN to the endpoint. For example, if the Private Link resource is an Azure Storage table, the FQDN will be something like mystorageaccount1234.table.core.windows.net.

Here are a few key points to consider when evaluating Private Endpoint:

- Private Endpoint offers private connectivity between virtual machines and other clients on your Azure virtual network and Private Link-powered Azure services.
- Private Endpoint offers private connectivity between your regionally peered virtual networks and Private Link-powered Azure services.
- Private Endpoint offers private connectivity between your globally peered virtual networks and Private Link-powered Azure services.
- Private Endpoint offers private connectivity between your on-premises network—connected via ExpressRoute Private Peering or a VPN—and Private Link-powered Azure services.
- You can deploy a maximum of 1,000 Private Endpoint interfaces per virtual network.
- You can deploy a maximum of 64,000 Private Endpoint interfaces per Azure subscription.
- You can map a maximum of 1,000 Private Endpoint interfaces to the same Private Link resource.

 Caution

Although it's possible to map multiple Private Endpoint interfaces to a single resource, it's not recommended because doing so can lead to DNS conflicts and other problems. The best practice is to map only a single Private Endpoint to a single Private Link resource.

- Connections are one way, meaning that only clients can connect to a Private Endpoint interface. If an Azure service is mapped to a Private Endpoint interface, the provider of that service can't connect to (or even perceive) the Private Endpoint interface.
- A deployed Private Endpoint interface is read-only, meaning that no one can modify it. For example, no one can map the interface to a different resource, nor can anyone change the interface's IP address.
- Although you must deploy the Private Endpoint in the same region as your virtual network, the Private Link resource can be located in a different region.

 Note

What is the difference between a service endpoint and a private endpoint? A _service endpoint_ configures an Azure resource to allow connections only from a specified virtual network. However, that connection is still made via the resource's public endpoint, so some security risks remain. Private Endpoint removes those risks by supporting the disabling of a resource's public endpoint.

## How Azure Private Link Service works

Azure Private Link Service brings the benefits of Private Link to your custom Azure services. The only requirement is that you run your custom service behind Azure Standard Load Balancer. You can then create a Private Link Service resource and attach it to the load balancer.

 Caution

Azure offers two versions of its load balancer: basic and standard. Basic Load Balancer doesn't support Private Link Service, so be sure you're using Standard Load Balancer.

Once you create the Private Link Service resource, Azure issues an _alias_ for the resource, which is a globally unique read-only string with the syntax _prefix_._guid_._suffix_:

- _prefix_. A name you supply for the custom service.
- _guid_. A globally unique ID generated automatically by Azure.
- _suffix_. The text _region.azure.privatelinkservice_; region is the region where the Private Link Service is deployed.

You share the Private Link Service alias with the consumers of your custom service. Each consumer then sets up a Private Endpoint in their own Azure virtual network. The consumer then maps the endpoint to the Private Link Service alias.

Here are some key points to consider when evaluating Private Link Service:

- Your Private Link Service can be accessed via a private endpoint in any public region.
- The Private Link Service must be deployed in the same region as the standard load balancer and the virtual network that hosts your custom Azure service.
- You can deploy a maximum of 800 Private Link Service resources per Azure subscription.
- A maximum of 1,000 Private Endpoint interfaces can map to a single Private Link Service resource.
- You can deploy multiple Private Link Service resources on the same standard load balancer using different front-end IP configurations.

## Putting it all together

Is your goal to access an Azure resource without using the public internet? Do you want to offer a custom Azure resource privately? If you answered yes to one or both questions, then Private Link, Private Endpoint, and Private Link Service get the job done as follows:

- To privately access an Azure PaaS service or an Azure service from a Microsoft Partner, create a private endpoint in a subnet of your Azure virtual network. That private endpoint uses Private Link to access the Azure service using a private IP address over the Microsoft Azure backbone. Peered virtual networks and on-premises networks that use ExpressRoute private peering or a VPN tunnel can also access the Azure service via the private endpoint.
- To offer private access to a custom Azure service, place the service behind a standard load balancer, create a Private Link Service resource, and attach it to the load balancer's front-end IP configuration.
