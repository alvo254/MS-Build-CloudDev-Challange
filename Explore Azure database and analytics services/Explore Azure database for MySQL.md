Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service in the cloud, and it's based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine, versions 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. With it, you have a 99.99 percent availability service-level agreement from Azure, powered by a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. This helps keep your app running 24/7. With every Azure Database for MySQL server, you take advantage of built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection that you would otherwise have to buy or design, build, and manage. With Azure Database for MySQL, you can use point-in-time restore to recover a server to an earlier state, as far back as 35 days.  

Azure Database for MySQL delivers:

- Built-in high availability with no additional cost.
- Predictable performance and inclusive, pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Scale as needed, within seconds.
- Ability to protect sensitive data at rest and in motion.
- Automatic backups.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

These capabilities require almost no administration, and all are provided at no additional cost. They allow you to focus on rapid app development and accelerating your time to market rather than having to manage virtual machines and infrastructure. In addition, you can migrate your existing MySQL databases with minimal downtime by using the Azure Database Migration Service. After you have completed your migration, you can continue to develop your application with the open-source tools and platform of your choice. You don't have to learn new skills.

Azure Database for MySQL offers several service tiers, and each tier provides different performance and capabilities to support lightweight to heavyweight database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.
