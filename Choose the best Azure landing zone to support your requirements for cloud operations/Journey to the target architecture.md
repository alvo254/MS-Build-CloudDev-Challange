Adopting cloud technologies is a journey. Business priorities and the need to bring new technologies online to unlock capabilities or features influence the speed at which an organization deploys and scales out a cloud environment.

Over time, the organization iterates and matures the deployed technologies, processes, and skills needed to progress toward that destination. The time for the journey depends on the size of the organization, the current technical footprint, and the maturity of skills within technical teams.

## On-ramps

Consider an analogy of a trip along a freeway. There might be multiple on-ramps that you can use to join the freeway, but the destination is the same. The following on-ramps represent where organizations are today in their cloud adoption plans. They also represent the specific guidance that you need to continue to develop the cloud environment.

|On-ramp|Description|Further guidance|
|---|---|---|
|**Start**|For organizations that are at the beginning of their cloud adoption journey (called _greenfield_) and want to implement a new cloud environment, based on best practices and proven architectural patterns.<br><br>Start with the conceptual architecture of Azure landing zones to understand the recommended end state.<br><br>Next, explore each of the design areas. Use the areas to understand the considerations and decisions that you need to design and implement the landing zone that best fits your requirements.|[What is an Azure landing zone?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)<br><br>[Azure landing zone design areas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas)|
|**Align**|For organizations that have an existing environment that needs modification to align to the target architecture and best practices for an Azure landing zone (called _brownfield_).<br><br>Use the transition from brownfield guidance to understand the decision points and technical approach to refactoring environments to align with the guidance in the Ready methodology.|[Refactor a landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/refactor)<br><br>[Transition existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/transition)<br><br>[Scenarios: Transitioning existing Azure environments to the Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/align-scenarios)|

## Landing zone review

The [landing zone review](https://aka.ms/LandingZoneReview) helps you assess your current Azure environment. It also helps you get customized recommendations for remediating the current state to align with the conceptual architecture of Azure landing zones.

You can use the transition guidance from the output of the assessment, best practices, and automation guidance, export via Excel, and import to Azure DevOps.
