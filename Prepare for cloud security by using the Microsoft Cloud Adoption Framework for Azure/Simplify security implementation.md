Azure landing zones are a logical construct that captures everything that must be true to enable application migrations and development at scale in Azure. Landing zones consider all platform resources that are required to support your organization's application portfolio. Azure landing zones provide cloud adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads.

Landing zones help with cloud adoption by creating better ways to organize resources, not just by type but by organization, cost, and security. Watch the following video.

When you design and implement an Azure landing zone, consider security throughout the process. The security design area focuses on considerations and recommendations for landing zone decisions. Azure Security Benchmarks are built into Azure landing zones to make adopting a strong security stance easier.

The security design area creates a foundation for security across Azure, hybrid, and multicloud environments. The design considerations for security within the Azure landing zones focus on providing visibility into what's happening within the technical cloud estate.

Security monitoring and audit logging of Azure platform services are key components of a scalable framework. The security operations design considerations have in-scope security alerts, logs, and controls. They also include vulnerability management, shared responsibilities, and encryption and keys. The foundation can later be enhanced with security guidance outlined in the Secure methodology of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

Continue to learn about implementation options for Azure landing zones by reviewing the best practices in the [Ready methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Those practices help you to choose how and when to refactor your landing zone to better fit your needs.

Learn how Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones can help your organization accelerate cloud adoption from months to weeks. See the [Create an enterprise-scale architecture in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/enterprise-scale-architecture/) learning path.

## Security implementation best practices

Several key steps can help you to mitigate or avoid the business risk from cybersecurity attacks. They can also help you rapidly establish essential security practices in the cloud. Follow the steps to integrate security into your cloud adoption process.

Adhering to these steps helps you integrate security at critical points in the process. The goal is to avoid obstacles in cloud adoption and reduce unnecessary business or operational disruption.

These steps show you how to:

- Establish essential security practices.
- Modernize the security strategy.
- Develop a security plan.
- Secure new workloads.
- Secure existing cloud workloads.
- Govern to manage and improve security posture.

This [Get started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/security) describes the key steps. Use it to help you rapidly establish essential security practices in the cloud and integrate security into your cloud adoption process.
