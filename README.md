All this can be found on learn.microsoft.com I only did this because I might want to access this resources offline or without needing to login into my own learn account on the go or reference to something.

Resource logs These are generated at the Azure resources layer by
Azure resources such as Azure Key Vault, Azure Cosmos DB, virtual
machines (VMs), and so on. They provide insights into operations
performed within Azure resources. The contents of resource logs vary
depending on the type of Azure service or resource that generated
them. Resource logs are not collected by default. You must configure
diagnostic settings for each Azure resource to send resource logs to
one or more destinations.
