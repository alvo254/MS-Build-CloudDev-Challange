The [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) provides you with proven guidance to help with your cloud adoption journey. The Cloud Adoption Framework helps you create and implement the business and technology strategies needed to succeed in the cloud.

The Cloud Adoption Framework includes these stages:

1. Define your strategy.
2. Make a plan.
3. Ready your organization.
4. Adopt the cloud.
5. Govern and manage your cloud environments.

The govern stage focuses on cloud governance. You can refer back to the Cloud Adoption Framework for recommended guidance as you build your cloud governance strategy.

To help build your adoption strategy, the Cloud Adoption Framework breaks out each stage into further exercises and steps. Let's take a brief look at each stage.

### Define your strategy

Here, you answer why you're moving to the cloud and what you want to get out of cloud migration. Do you need to scale to meet demand or reach new markets? Will it reduce costs or increase business agility? When you define your cloud business strategy, you should understand [cloud economics](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloud-economics) and consider business impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more.

Here are the steps in this stage.

**Best practices**: Start with recommended and proven practices to help ensure that your cloud migration efforts are scalable and maintainable.

### Adopt the cloud

Here, you begin to migrate your applications to the cloud. Along the way, you might find ways to modernize your applications and build innovative solutions that use cloud services.

The Cloud Adoption Framework breaks this stage into two parts: migrate and innovate.

**Migrate**: Here are the steps in the migrate part of this stage.

**Migrate your first workload**: Use the Azure migration guide to deploy your first project to the cloud.

![1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/number-1-3c617397.png)

**Migration scenarios**: Use additional in-depth guides to explore more complex migration scenarios.

**Feedback loops**: Check in frequently with your customers to verify that you're building what they need.

### Govern and manage your cloud environments

Here, you begin to form your cloud governance and cloud management strategies. As the cloud estate changes over time, so do cloud governance processes and policies. You need to create resilient solutions that are constantly optimized.

**Govern**: Here are the steps in the govern part of this stage.

**Methodology**: Consider your end state solution. Then define a methodology that incrementally takes you from your first steps all the way to full cloud governance.

![1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/number-1-3c617397.png)

**Benchmark**: Use the [governance benchmark tool](https://cafbaseline.com/) to assess your current state and future state to establish a vision for applying the framework.

![2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/number-2-d7eaf4fc.png)

**Initial governance foundation**: Create an MVP that captures the first steps of your governance plan.

![3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure-fundamentals/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/media/number-3-e36c42fb.png)

**Improve the initial governance foundation**: Iteratively add governance controls that address tangible risks as you progress toward your end state solution.
